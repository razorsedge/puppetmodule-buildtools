## Overview

A one-maybe-two sentence summary of what the module does/what problem it solves. This is your 30 second elevator pitch for your module. Consider including OS/Puppet version it works with.

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration, management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What this module affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Requirements

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled, etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with this module

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading (For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).
